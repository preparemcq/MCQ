  Short Questions (20 Questions)
</p>
<p>
  1. Discuss three different criteria for ethical decision making.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      <br/>
      There are three different criteria in making ethical choices.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>a) </strong>
  <strong>
      The first is the utilitarian criterion, in which decisions are made
      solely on the basis of their outcomes or consequences. The goal of
      utilitarianism is to provide the greatest good for the greatest number.
      This is the view that tends to dominate business decision making.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>b) </strong>
  <strong>
      Another criterion is to focus on rights. This calls on individuals to
      make decisions consistent with fundamental liberties and privileges as
      set forth in documents like the Bill of Rights. An emphasis on rights
      in decision making means respecting and protecting the basic rights of
      individuals.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>c) </strong>
  <strong>
      A third criterion is to focus on justice. This requires individuals to
      impose and enforce rules fairly and impartially so there is an
      equitable distribution of benefits and costs. (Moderate; Ethics; p.
      157)
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  2. What is self-efficacy?<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Self-efficacy refers to an individual’s belief that he or she is
      capable of performing a task. The higher your self-efficacy, the more
      confidence you have in your ability to succeed in a task. Individuals
      high in self-efficacy seem to respond to negative feedback with
      increased effort and motivation, while those low in self-efficacy are
      likely to lessen their effort when given negative feedback. (Easy;
      Self-Efficacy; p. 188)

  3. Explain the three job redesign options.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>a) </strong>
  <strong><u>Job rotation</u></strong>
  <strong>
      . This is the practice of periodically shifting an employee from one
      task to another. When an activity is no longer challenging, the
      employee is rotated to another job, usually at the same level, that has
      similar skill requirements.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>b) </strong>
  <strong><u>Job enlargement</u></strong>
  <strong>
      . This is the expansion of jobs horizontally; increasing the number and
      variety of tasks that an individual performs. Instead of only sorting
      the incoming mail by department, for instance, a mail sorter’s job
      could be enlarged to include physically delivering the mail to the
      various departments or running outgoing letters through the postage
      meter.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>c) </strong>
  <strong><u>Job enrichment.</u></strong>
  <strong>
      Job enrichment refers to the vertical expansion of jobs. It increases
      the degree to which the worker controls the planning, execution, and
      evaluation of his or her work. An enriched job organizes tasks so as to
      allow the worker to do a complete activity, increases the employee’s
      freedom and independence, increases responsibility, and provides
      feedback, so an individual will be able to assess and correct his or
      her own performance. (Moderate; Job Redesign; pp. 218-220)

  4. Discuss whether there are gender differences regarding emotions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      The common belief is that women are more emotional than are men. Is
      there any truth to this? The evidence does confirm that women are more
      emotionally expressive than are men; they experience emotions more
      intensely; they tend to “hold onto” emotions longer than men, and they
      display more frequent expressions of both positive and negative
      emotions, except anger. Although there may be innate differences
      between the genders, research suggests that emotional differences also
      are due to the different ways men and women have been socialized. Men
      are taught to be tough and brave. Showing emotion is inconsistent with
      this image. Women, in contrast, are socialized to be nurturing. For
      instance, women are expected to express more positive emotions on the
      job (shown by smiling) than men, and they do

  5. What is team efficacy?
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Effective teams have confidence in themselves. They believe they can
      succeed. This is called team efficacy. Teams that have been successful
      raise their beliefs about future success, which in turn, motivates them
      to work harder. (Easy; Team Efficacy; p. 336) {AACSB: Analytic Skills}

  6. What is communication apprehension?
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Communication apprehension is a major barrier to effective
      communication. People who suffer from communication apprehension
      experience undue tension and anxiety in oral communication, written
      communication, or both. (Easy; Communication Apprehension; p. 370)

  7. What are the key dimensions that underlie the concept of trust?
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      The key dimensions that underlie the concept of trust are integrity,
      competence, consistency, loyalty, and openness.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>a) </strong>
  <strong>Integrity refers to honesty and truthfulness. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>b) </strong>
  <strong>
      Competence encompasses an individual’s technical and interpersonal
      knowledge and skills.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>c) </strong>
  <strong>
      Consistency relates to an individual’s reliability, predictability, and
      good judgment in handling situations.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>d) </strong>
  <strong>
      Loyalty is the willingness to protect and save face for another person.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  e)
  <strong>
      The final dimension of trust is openness, or the degree to which a
      person can be counted on to provide the full truth. (Moderate; Key
      Dimensions of Trust; p. 424)
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  8. What are defensive behaviors?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Defensive behaviors occur when people perceive politics as a threat
      rather than an opportunity. They respond with reactive and protective
      behaviors to avoid action, blame, or change. Defensive behaviors are
      often associated with negative feelings toward the job and work
      environment. In the short run, employees may find that defensiveness
      protects their self-interest. But in the long run, it is the only way
      they know how to behave. At that point, they lose the trust and support
      of their peers, bosses, employees, and clients. (Easy; Defensive
      Behaviors; p. 468)

  10. What is workforce spirituality?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Workplace spirituality is not about organized religious practices. It’s
      not about God or theology. Workplace spirituality recognizes that
      people have an inner life that nourishes and is nourished by meaningful
      work that takes place in the context of community. Organizations that
      promote a spiritual culture recognize that people have both a mind and
      a spirit, seek to find meaning and purpose in their work, and desire to
      connect with other human beings and be part of a community. (Easy;
      Workplace Spirituality; p. 570)

  11. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the selection interview.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Not only is the interview widely used, it also seems to carry a great
      deal of weight. That is, the results tend to have a disproportionate
      amount of influence on the selection decision. The candidate who
      performs poorly in the employment interview is likely to be cut from
      the applicant pool, regardless of his or her experience, test scores,
      or letters of recommendation. Conversely, all too often, the person
      most polished in job-seeking techniques, particularly those used in the
      interview process, is the one hired, even though he or she may not be
      the best candidate for the position. (Easy; Interviews; p. 588)

  12. Explain how Fred Luthans differentiates between successful and
  effective managers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Luthans defined successful managers in terms of the speed of their
      promotions. Effective managers were defined in terms of the quantity
      and quality of their performance and the satisfaction and commitment of
      their employees. Different skills were associated with each group.
      Successful managers used more networking skills, whereas effective
      managers used more communication skills. (Easy; Effective Versus
      Successful Managers; p. 9)

</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  13. How can managers shape employee behavior?
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Managers can shape employee behavior by systematically reinforcing each
      successive step that moves the individual closer to the desired
      response. Managers can mold individuals by guiding their learning in
      graduated steps. Reinforcement increases as responses more closely
      approximate the desired behavior. Managers may use positive
      reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment, and extinction to
      promote this gradual shaping of employee behavior. (Easy; Shaping; p.
      58)

  14. List and explain the four ways employees can express job
  dissatisfaction.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Employees can express dissatisfaction by using exit, voice, loyalty,
      and neglect. These arise from whether a response is active or passive,
      and constructive or destructive.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1) </strong>
  <strong>
      Behavior directed toward leaving the organization is defined as exit
      behavior. It is active and destructive.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2) </strong>
  <strong>
      Voice involves actively and constructively attempting to improve
      conditions, including suggesting improvements, discussing problems with
      superiors, and some forms of union activity.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3) </strong>
  <strong>
      Loyalty involves passively but optimistically waiting for conditions to
      improve, so it is passive and constructive.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4) </strong>
  <strong>
      Neglect is passively allowing conditions to worsen, including chronic
      absenteeism or lateness, reduced effort, and increased error rate, so
      it is a passive and destructive response.

  15. Discuss the “Big Five” model of personality.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      The five-factor model of personality is typically called the “Big
      Five.” An impressive body of research supports its thesis that five
      basic dimensions underlie all others and encompass most of the
      significant variation in human personality. Research on the Big Five
      has found relationships between these personality dimensions and job
      performance. (Easy; Big Five Personality Model; pp. 108-109)
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  16. Identify and briefly describe the five key traits in the Big Five
  personality model.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      The five key traits in the Big Five personality model are extroversion,
      agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to
      experience.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>a) </strong>
  <strong>
      Extroversion captures one’s comfort level with relationships.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>b) </strong>
  <strong>
      Agreeableness refers to an individual’s propensity to defer to others.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>c) </strong>
  <strong>Conscientiousness is a measure of reliability. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>d) </strong>
  <strong>
      Emotional stability taps a person’s ability to withstand stress.
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>e) </strong>
  <strong>
      Openness to experience addresses one’s range of interests and
      fascination with novelty.

  17. Discuss the importance of values.
</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      Values are important to the study of organizational behavior because
      they lay the foundation for the understanding of attitudes and
      motivation and because they influence our perceptions. Individuals
      enter an organization with preconceived notions of what “ought” and
      what “ought not” to be. These notions are not value-free. They contain
      interpretations of right and wrong. Values cloud objectivity and
      rationality. Values generally influence attitudes and behavior. (Easy;
      Importance of Values; p. 117)

</p>
<p>
  <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
      A quality circle is a work group of eight to ten employees and
      supervisors who have a shared area of responsibility. They meet
      regularly to discuss their quality problems, investigate causes of the
      problems, recommend solutions, and take corrective actions. (Easy;
